# C) Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

##  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

##  Program
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
comp_num=complex(a,b)
print(comp_num)
print(comp_num.real)
print(comp_num.imag)
```

## Output
<img width="754" height="414" alt="446572657-924e54df-7851-4a42-98bb-cc4155ada47a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ab46336-922d-475e-bb3d-5046fdc89bec" />

## Result
Thus the python program to convert the real number into complex number is executed successfully.
