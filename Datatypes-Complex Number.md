# Ex 1a:Datatypes-Adding Complex Number in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program that adds two complex numbers and displays the result.
## Algorithm
1.Start the program.

2.Initialize two complex numbers c1 and c2.

3.Add the two complex numbers using the + operator.

4.Store the result in another variable.

5.Print the final sum.

6.End the program.

## Program
```
c1=4+2j

c2=5+3j
c3=c1+c2
print(c3)
```
