# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## 🧾 Program
```
v = 'T'
w = "a"
print(v)
print(w)
```

## Output
<img width="520" height="191" alt="446569556-db0a8de7-5f0c-499f-95ec-59c683de7cf4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5051c895-cb03-4201-affc-57507297a3c7" />

## Result
Thus the python program to print the character literal is executed successfully.
