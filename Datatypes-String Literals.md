# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## 🧾 Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=int(input())
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
<img width="507" height="223" alt="446570750-965a06a5-d72a-4862-83d3-b78a166fb084" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/938fe6f1-446e-4164-9133-915e3feb040b" />

## Result
Thus the python program to get the input from the user and print it executed successfully.
